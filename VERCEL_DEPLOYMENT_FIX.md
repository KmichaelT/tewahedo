# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The 404 error was occurring because of a mismatch between the file paths in the build output and the paths referenced in the start script. 

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Build Script in package.json
Modified the build script to use the correct outbase parameter:

```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts api/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist/api --outbase=server"
```

The previous configuration was using `--outbase=.` which was causing server files to be placed in `dist/api/server/` directory. By changing to `--outbase=server`, the server files will be placed directly in the `dist/api/` directory.

### 2. Updated Start Script in package.json
Modified the start script to point to the correct file path:

```json
"start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/api/index.js"
```

The previous start script was looking for the file at `dist/api/server/index.js`, but with our build configuration change, the file is now at `dist/api/index.js`.

## Vercel Configuration
The vercel.json file is already properly configured with routes that handle both the API and static assets. The routes configuration ensures that:

1. API requests are routed to the serverless function
2. Static assets are served from the correct directories
3. All other requests fall back to the index.html file

## Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set in the Vercel project settings, including:

- Database connection string
- Firebase authentication credentials
- CORS configuration
- Session secret

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your Git repository
2. Deploy to Vercel using the Vercel dashboard or CLI
3. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues
4. Test the application to ensure all routes and static assets are working correctly

These changes should resolve the 404 error by ensuring that the file paths in the build output match the paths expected by the start script and Vercel configuration.
