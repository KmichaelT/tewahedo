# Vercel Deployment Summary

## Changes Made for Vercel Deployment

The following changes have been made to prepare the application for deployment on Vercel:

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`

- Added `.env` and `.env.*` to `includeFiles` to ensure environment variables are included
- Specified Node.js version 22.x for compatibility (updated from 18.x)
- Added `zeroConfig: true` to the static build configuration
- Updated API route destination to point directly to the API entry point
- Fixed static asset routing to correctly point to `/dist/public/assets/` directory
- Added environment variable configuration for production

### 2. Enhanced Module Resolution in `api/index.ts`

- Improved the dynamic import logic for both `routes.ts` and `replitAuth.ts`
- Added fallback import paths to handle various Vercel serverless environments
- Added additional import path resolution using `process.cwd()` as a last resort

### 3. Updated `package.json`

- Modified the build script to include both server and API entry points
- Added a `vercel-build` script specifically for Vercel deployments

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

```
# Database Connection
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=postgresql://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=require

# Firebase Configuration
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id

# Session Secret
SESSION_SECRET=generate_a_random_string_here

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 2. Deployment Steps

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Configure the project settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`
3. Add all environment variables
4. Deploy the project

### 3. Database Setup

- For PostgreSQL, use Vercel Postgres or Neon Database
- Make sure to update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the correct connection string
- Run database migrations using Drizzle ORM if needed

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Errors for Static Assets

If you encounter 404 errors when loading static assets (JS, CSS, images):

1. Check that the routes in `vercel.json` correctly point to the actual file locations in the build output
2. Ensure the `dest` paths in the routes configuration match the directory structure of your build
3. For assets referenced in HTML with paths like `/assets/...`, make sure the corresponding route in `vercel.json` points to `/dist/public/assets/$1`

### Module Not Found Errors

If you encounter module not found errors:

1. Check the Vercel build logs to identify which modules are missing
2. Verify that all necessary files are included in the `includeFiles` section of `vercel.json`
3. Make sure the import paths in your code are using the dynamic import pattern

### Database Connection Issues

If you have issues connecting to the database:

1. Verify that your database is accessible from Vercel's servers
2. Check that the connection string format is correct for your database provider
3. For Neon or other serverless PostgreSQL providers, ensure you're using the correct connection parameters

### CORS Issues

If you encounter CORS issues:

1. Update the allowed origins in your Express.js CORS configuration to include your Vercel deployment URL
2. Make sure your API routes are correctly configured in `vercel.json`

## Next Steps

1. Monitor your application in the Vercel dashboard
2. Check the logs for any errors or issues
3. Set up custom domains if needed
4. Configure automatic deployments from your GitHub repository

Your application should now be successfully deployed to Vercel!
